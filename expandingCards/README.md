# Expanding Card Widget

As I endeavor to expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I decided to
buy the Udemy course
[50 Projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23594652#overview)
by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. This expanding cards project is the first of
many and allows me to deepen my understanding of CSS Flexbox and review some
basic JS concepts. This can be used for other projects such a testimonials, FAQs
or even trivia cards! Please take a look!
